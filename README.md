## About the Course

A practical, hands-on deep dive into **Chrome DevTools** for debugging, performance analysis, accessibility auditing, and memory profiling. The course focuses on using DevTools as a **professional debugging environment**, not just a console replacement.

Key topics include:

* 🧩 **DOM & CSS inspection**: Live editing, computed styles, box model analysis, and state simulation
* 🧠 **Advanced debugging**: Breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, call stacks, and scope inspection
* 🌐 **Network performance analysis**: Waterfall charts, request timing, caching, preload & prefetch
* 🚀 **Performance profiling**: RAIL model, main thread analysis, avoiding jank
* 🧹 **Memory & leaks**: Heap snapshots, garbage collection, retained vs shallow size
* 🔍 **Lighthouse audits**: Performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices
* ♿ **Accessibility tooling**: Color contrast checks and accessibility insights
* 🧪 **DevTools experiments & AI features**: Exploring experimental workflows

The course combines real-world debugging scenarios with performance and memory investigations you actually encounter in production applications.

## 🚀 Why I Took This Course

I already had hands-on experience using Chrome DevTools in daily development, but I took this course to **sharpen and deepen my understanding** beyond surface-level usage.

My goals were to:

✔ Move beyond `console.log()` to **systematic debugging**
✔ Understand **how browsers load, render, and execute code**
✔ Confidently analyze **performance bottlenecks and memory leaks**
✔ Use DevTools as a **diagnostic and optimization toolkit**, not just an inspector
✔ Read and act on **Lighthouse reports** with real understanding

This course significantly improved my ability to:

* Debug complex JavaScript issues faster
* Identify network and rendering bottlenecks
* Profile real performance problems instead of guessing
* Detect and reason about memory leaks
* Make informed performance and accessibility improvements

## 📢 Access Note

Due to regional restrictions in Iran, I accessed this course through alternative means. While I don’t have an official certificate, I completed all coding exercises and have documented my implementations and key takeaways in this repository.
